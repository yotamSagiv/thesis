.*_regression_agent.py contain code for the task/agent simulations. 
In logistic_regression_agent.py, the agent infers a sigmoid for the probability of success function, whereas in
linear_regression_agent.py, they infer a line.

Other code (ceqplot, path, etc.) is either for figure generation or for running the various simulations on a cluster.
